# TF2-ECJ-JumpAssist

Seriously though, this plugin is ugly. I need to revise/rewrite this thing.

I'll make documentation at some point, but for now, just dig through the source.

## Various differences compared to nolem's version:

Included regen for engineer metal.

Removed soundhook since it's now included within my hide plugin.

Updated database syntx.

Changed hardcore capture message and sound.

Removed updater.
Removed goto, since that is now part of another plugin I use.

Commented out various unused commands and/or changed access to root admin.
